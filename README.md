- X64 fix + Triggerbotm, NoFlash : owerosu

## Notes
* Requires Xlib (both `libx11-dev:i386` and `libx11-dev`). XOSD (`xosd-bin`) is for the ingame overlay. It's optional though.
* Bind in this Pull Request is Ctrl+Shift+X, but this is not optimal for gameplay.

## Known Bugs
* Triggering does not work with Numlock enabled.

## Features
* ESP (s0beit)
* NoFlash (owerosu)
* Triggerbot (owersu, fix by kaby47)
* Overlay (kaby47)
